                        <p>Amsterdam has various bus lines and a regional network connecting the capital to surrounding
                            suburbs and towns. Remember when travelling by bus to raise your hand when you want to get
                            on,
                            to ensure that the driver has seen you, and to enter at the front. Amsterdam also has a
                            late-night network, with night rates. Night buses leaving from 01.00 am onwards, mainly
                            depart/arrive at Central Station. Night buses can easily be boarded by checking in with your
                            Public Transport card (OV-chipkaart). The start tariff is different for this journey (€
                            4.50).

            <h1>How can you use the OV?</h1>
            <p>Actually the OV chip card is easy to use. All you have to do is to hold your card to the scaner both at
                the
                entrance and the exit. You can use the scaner inside the vehicle on buses and trams, but in trains and
                metro, you have to have your card read at the turnstiles before going to the platform.</p>
