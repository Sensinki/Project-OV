            <h2>Public Transport</h2>
            <p>Amsterdam has an efficient public transport system with various bus and tram routes, metro lines and
                ferry
                links. The authority that operates them is called GVB which stands for Gemeentevervoerbedrijf (Municipal
                Transport Authority).</p>
            <p>The best way to find your way around is by using the public transport enquiries app
                called 9292. Their website 9292ov.nl, which is also available in English and German, offers information
                about rates, routes, lines and timetables. Google Maps also offers information on public transport.</p>
            <p>Dutch students have a public transport pass (called the OV-chipkaart) which allows them to travel for
                free
                during the week or on weekends. Some EU/EEA students may also be eligible for one, but only if you
                receive a
                Dutch student grant. To see if you are entitled to a student trav-el card, check the National Bureau for
                Student Grants’s (DUO) website at duo.nl, or call +31 505997755.</p>

            <h2>OV chip card</h2>
            <p>On all forms of public transport and with all operators na-tionwide, the ticket used is called an
                OV card (public transport smart card). You can either get a personalised card or a general one which
                you deposit money on. Ma-chines to top up can be found at train stations, supermar-kets, kiosks and
                newsagents. On buses and trams, you can also buy a disposable OV card from the driver, but they are
                relatively expensive. You can’t pay with cash on Dutch public transport.</p>
            <p>Remember, at the start of your journey, to always check in by holding your card against one of the card
                readers. For train journeys you cannot check in if the balance on your card is below € 20. At the end of
                your journey, or f you change to another mode of transport, you check out. On buses and trams – you must
                check out and check back in – even when just changing to a different line. If you forget to check out, €
                4
                will be deducted from your card when travelling by bus, tram or metro. For more information about the
                OV card, check the website ov-chipkaart.nl (also in English).</p>
